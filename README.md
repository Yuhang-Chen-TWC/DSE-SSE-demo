# DSE-SSE-demo
demo code for our TWC paper, Hybrid Spherical- and Planar-Wave Channel Modeling and Estimation for Terahertz Integrated UM-MIMO and IRS Systems

This is a demo of the DSE, and SSE algorithms proposed in our paper:

Y. Chen, R. Li, C. Han, S. Sun and M. Tao, "Hybrid Spherical- and Planar-Wave Channel Modeling and Estimation for Terahertz Integrated UM-MIMO and IRS Systems," in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol. 22, no. 12, pp. 9746-9761, Dec. 2023.

In this demo, we consider the UM-MIMO system without IRS.
