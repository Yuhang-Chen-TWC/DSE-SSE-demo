This is a demo for the DSE, SSE algorithms proposed in our paper: 

Y. Chen, R. Li, C. Han, S. Sun and M. Tao, "Hybrid Spherical- and Planar-Wave Channel Modeling and Estimation for Terahertz Integrated UM-MIMO and IRS Systems," to appear, *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications*. 

In this demo, we consider the UM-MIMO system without IRS.
